Basics of Scala Progarmming
Day1: Going through how to create classes and how to provide the instance variable for classes.
Not clear with accessors and mutators
example: 
class Time(var h:Int,var m:Int) {     class Time(val h:Int,val m:Int) {


}                                      }

can you please  clarify on this?
